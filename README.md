# Enterprise Hotel Network Design | Cisco Packet Tracer 🏨🌐

As part of my learning journey toward becoming a Penetration Tester, I designed and implemented a secure enterprise-level hotel network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project simulates a real-world enterprise environment and demonstrates secure network segmentation, dynamic routing, and infrastructure protection.

The network consists of three floors, each containing multiple departments isolated using VLANs with dedicated IP networks. Inter-VLAN communication is enabled using Router-on-a-Stick, while routers are interconnected using serial links and configured with OSPF to dynamically exchange routes.

## Key Features

- VLAN segmentation for all departments  
- Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)  
- OSPF dynamic routing between routers  
- DHCP configuration for automatic IP assignment  
- Secure remote access using SSH  
- Port Security using Sticky MAC and Shutdown mode  
- Wireless network integration using Access Points  
- Structured enterprise network design  

## Security Implementation

Security measures were implemented to simulate real-world enterprise protection, including SSH for secure remote management, Port Security to prevent unauthorized access, VLAN isolation to reduce attack surface, and a dedicated Test-PC to validate secure administrative access.

## Skills Demonstrated

Enterprise Network Design, VLAN Configuration, Inter-VLAN Routing, OSPF, DHCP, SSH, Port Security, Network Segmentation, and Infrastructure Security.

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco IOS CLI  

## Purpose

This project is part of my cybersecurity and penetration testing learning path, helping me build strong foundations in enterprise networking and secure network infrastructure.
