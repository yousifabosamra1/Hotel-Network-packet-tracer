# Secure Hotel Network Infrastructure Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure hotel network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network simulates a real-world hotel environment with multiple departments such as Reception, Administration, Guest Rooms, and IT Department, with proper segmentation and security controls.

## Security Implementation
The network is secured using VLAN segmentation and controlled remote access. Only an authorized Test PC located in the IT Department is allowed to remotely access network devices via SSH for management purposes. Unauthorized devices are restricted from accessing critical network infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Design a secure and scalable hotel network
- Segment departments using VLANs
- Implement Inter-VLAN routing
- Restrict administrative access to authorized devices only
- Configure secure remote access using SSH
- Provide automatic IP addressing using DHCP

## Network Features
- VLAN segmentation for each department
- Inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick
- Secure SSH remote management
- Access restricted to authorized Test PC only
- DHCP for automatic IP assignment
- Full connectivity testing between devices

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN Configuration
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- SSH Security Configuration
- DHCP Configuration
- Cisco Routers and Switches

## Security Purpose
This project demonstrates enterprise-level network security practices, including access control, segmentation, and secure device management, which are essential skills for cybersecurity and penetration testing roles.
